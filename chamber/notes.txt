you will be targeting the button using java script 

you can have a class in css that will target the button using js that isn't assigned to 
anything in HTML, so you will assign it using JS 

css:
.newstyle{
    background-color: red;
}

if you want something to disapear when clicked:
.newstyle{
    display:none;  (you then use the toggle in JS)
}

js:
let button = documnet.querySelector('.btn');
let title = document.querySelector('h2'); (if you want to target the h2)

toggle will add it and take it away - lets it move 
function show() {
    button.classList.toggle('newstyle');
}

this is listening for a click 
button.addEventListener('click', show);

(shorter syntax for formatted date) DATE:

const date_now = new Date();
const full_date = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-us', {dateStyle: 'full'}).format(date._now);


LARGE DISPLAY:
it will all be display block 


ADDING A HERO PIC AND BUTTON 

create a parent container with an ID 
then create a div in that div
ex. <div id='parent-container'> 
        <div id='child-overlay'>
            <button>Click Me</button>
        </div>
    </div>

    css:
    #parent-container{
        position: relative;
    }
    #child-overlay{
        position: absolute;
        //once you say absolue you can say exactly where you want it to go
        right: 50px;
        left: 50px;
    }

    (if the button goes behind the parent, then use the z-index to fix it)

adding a favicon to your site (the icon that shows up in the browser)
    put the image at the root at your project folder (same level as the index) 
    then put the link in the head
        <link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico">
    you have to call/name it favicon 



have a message that will only show on mondays and tuesdays:

css - have it be initially display: none
js - you want an if statment and need a date object (.getDay())
    .getDay() will return 0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, etc. 

    if getDay() is 1 or 2 then change display to block 
        show on wewbpage: do a setAttribute to a new class or .styleDisplay:block 




WEEK 6 NOTES

DON'T USE BITMAP
good for images: jpg (good cause it can be compressed, but once it's compressed the info is lost and it can't be reversed)
                png (you can have transparency)
                svg (uses math so it will never get pixelated - scalable vector graphic)
                webp 
cloudconvert.com
convertio.co
    both of these sites can be used to convert files 

optimize and then compress the image: (or do it all on photoshop) 
optimize images: picresize.com 
compress it: tinypng.com


3 different hero images:
    add small, medium, and large on the image in photoshop (keep the originals)
    img 900, img 700, img 400 - thats the different sizes you'll want 


WEEK 7 (LOCAL STORAGE)
to find the days since visited:
    let current = Date.now();
(pull from local storage)
    let previous = ....
then you will subtract the two 
    let difference = current - previous 
    let diffdays = math.floor(difference/1000/60/60/24);
        (this will tell you the difference in days instead of seconds)


ex. (if they don't have anything in there then set the item)
if (!something in local storage){
    set localStorage to todays date 
    'This is your first visit'
} else{
    get the local storage value (calling a function)
    subtract the two dates - today and the previous date (/1000/60/60/24) (calling a function)
    set the new date in local storage 
}





DIRECTORY 

create a seperate JS file 

have an "addEventListener" in order to change from cards to tabls view
and then once they've clicked it we also need to hide the cards 
    ex. on how to hide the cards 
    option 1
    card.style.display = 'none';

    option 2
    card.forEach((item) => {
        item.remove();
    })

you can wrap the cards or table in a whole div and then just hide the divs 
    (<div class="cards"></div>)

function displaying the cards will delete the table (or hide)
function displaying the table will delete the cards (or hide) 

BUTTONS:
go to google fonts and go to the icon section 
    download the png and insert the image with the "addEventListener"
or you can go to w3schools html symbols and you can use that (&#9868; and &#9871;)
    you can just put those into a buttom tab


table vertical (small view):
    grab the <td> in phone view and change it to display:block 
    you need to turn it off for when it gets bigger (display:inline)




EXTRA CREDIT - table at medium 
    window.addEventListener('resize', reportwindow)

    reportwindow (function)
        if the window is this width call the card function 
        it the window is this width call the table fucntion
